        <h1>Champagne, Swords, and Braised Meats.</h1>
        <h3>Never has this combination of things made more sense than at Sabre.</h3>

        <p>Sabre's menu features the perfect pairing of small plates with sparkling wine, including oysters, homemade cheese and cured meats, and whole roasted pig. A prix fixe menu is offered on a nightly basis.</p>

        <div <p>Are you finding the current cork-twisting method of opening bottles of bubbly a bit anticlimactic? Sabre offers tableside lessons in the art of sabrage, the fiercest way to pop champagne.</p></div>
