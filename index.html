<h1>Website Inspirations and Ideas</h1>

    <h2><em>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</em></h2>

        <p><ul>
           <li><a href="http://www.aloha.com">Aloha</a></li><br>

           <li><a href="http://www.nest.com">Nest</a></li></ul></p>

    <h2><em>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size, or balance?</em></h2>

        <p><ul>
           <li>Aloha: This website is attempting to accomplish a lot, and design is making their call to action easier to understand. Aloha's use of spacing is particularly remarkable. The focal image on the index page is busy, but visually interesting, encouraging a user to scroll below the fold. The size informs the balance on this website and the scale serves to highlight a variety of products on the site, rather than focusing on one.</li><br>

           <br><li>Nest: This site has particularly pleasing symmetry as well as an effective focal point. A website such as this can be tricky to design since the entire site is dedicated to the sale of a single product. Their description of the use of the product and its effectiveness is easy to read and very appealing.</li></ul></p>

    <h2><em>What makes the websites similar and different?</em></h2>

        <p>The websites are actually quite similar, not only in their use of balance and size, but also in their use of symmetry, with a focus on two columns. The websites also both use an interesting combination of vertical and horizontal features; for example, the Nest website has a rolling slideshow of images/information on the index page, and the initial image on the Aloha site is a video that pans left to right.<br>

        The websites are different in their scale and use of balance and spacing. The Ahola website is much busier than the Nest site, which is cleaner and more slightly more symmetrical. The Aloha site has a variety of images and text, while Nest is more streamlined and concise.</p><br>
