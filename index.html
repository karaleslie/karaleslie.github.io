<h1>About Me: Kara Leslie</h1>
    <p>I'm an arts non-profit professional living in San Francisco, CA. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I'm looking to transition fields and feel as though having these skills will be useful. Plus, I've seen the future and, as it turns out, anyone without a basic knowledge of programming languages will perish. So it's pretty dire.</p> 
<h2>My Mission</h2> 

    <p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a product or community manager with any company whose values and mission I support. It's WAY easier to work in an environment and with a team that you feel inspired by.</p>

<h2>My Experience</h2>

    <p>This is how I've evolved professionally:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Volunteer Manager</strong>, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco<br>

      <li><strong>Festival Coordinator</strong>, San Francisco International Film Festival<br>
      <em>San Francisco, June 2012-June 2013</em></li><br>
